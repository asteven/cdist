UNASSIGNED TODOS
----------------
The following list of todos has not been assigned to any developer.
Feel free to pick one!

CORE
----
- Add subcommand to create template of a type with working manpage
 (cdist type-template or so)

TESTS
-----
- multiple defines of object:
   - fail if different parameters
   - succeed if same parameters

USER INTERFACE
--------------
- add support $__tmp?
   - for use in manifest, code, etc.?
      - for creating temporary files, etc.

- How to cleanly implement "restart service if config file changed"

- Cache
   - add example how to use 
   - export variable $__cache
      -> for current host
      -> add function to cdist-config, import from cdist-cache

- Define / document "this is what should be on host X"
   and have it parsable by different (shinken) tool
   -> given after manifest run already!

- use absent/present for state by default?
- buggy output with packages that don't exist in archlinux and fedora:
   python3 vs. python

TYPES
------
- __ssh-keys (host/user)
- __file_edit
   - regexp replace (can probably cover all?)
      -> aka sed.
- __user
   add option to include --create-home

DOCUMENTATION
--------------
- asciidoc interprets __, which we use for variables
  names -> seek through docs and replace with \_\_!
- reference explorers in cdist-reference!
