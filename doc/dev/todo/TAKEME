UNASSIGNED TODOS
----------------
The following list of todos has not been assigned to any developer.
Feel free to pick one!

CORE
----
- Inconsistent error messages if object is not existing!
   -> always use "Object undefined"
- Add echo function / beautify output
   __cdist_echo [level] [messages...]
      level := syslog alike:
         debug, notice, err
   Include object_self prefixing, if given!
- Think about moving cdist-type-build-emulation out of cdist-manifest-run to
   cdist-deploy-to: more dependency of cdist-manifest-run, but a lot of
   less cycles consumed

- cdist-object-gencode: remove code if output empty?
   - also take care of that in cdist-code-run!
- Remove cdist-object-push, covers only one line and is used only once:
   [20:22] kr:bin% grep cdist-object-push *
   cdist-object-run:   cdist-object-push          "$__cdist_target_host" "$__cdist_object"
   [20:22] kr:bin% 

- probably remove or improve cdist-type-template
- add $__tmp?
   - for use in manifest, code, etc.?
      - for creating temporary files, etc.

- How to cleanly implement "restart service if config file changed"

- Cache
   - add example how to use 
   - export variable $__cache
      -> for current host
      -> add function to cdist-config, import from cdist-cache

- Think about $__object_remote[_dir], so one can use
   these paths in gencode/manifest

TYPES
------
- __ssh-keys (host/user)
- __file_edit
   - regexp replace (can probably cover all?)
      -> aka sed.
- __user
   add option to include --create-home

DOCUMENTATION
--------------
- asciidoc interprets __, which we use for variables
  names -> seek through docs and replace with \_\_!
- reference explorers in cdist-reference!
- compare running times:
   one, 5, 10, 50, 100, 1000 hosts => how does cdist scale?
