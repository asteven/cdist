== goal ==
- handle both system wide /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts and user ~/.ssh/known_hosts
- add known hosts manually
- automatically add known hosts from cache


== todo ==
x explorer that collects keys from all hosts
   - key types:
      ecdsa-sha2-nistp256
      ssh-dss
      ssh-rsa
x parameters:
   --key 'ssh-rsa ...' # key to add manually
   --from-cache # boolean, get keys from cache
   --owner #
- generate /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts from collected keys in cache


== problems ==
- no offical/supported api/path to interacct with cache
- how to deal with HashKnownHosts?
- which key to add if a host has multiple types? or add multiple entries, one for each key type?
